# Introduction

**HabiPet** is a habit-building app that allows users to set and track personal habits by defining goals for daily and weekly completion. Consistently completing habits rewards users with in-app coins, which they can spend in the shop to purchase animated pets, unique skins, and customizable backgrounds.

These features aim to motivate users through positive reinforcement, gamification, and interactive rewards - making habit-building an engaging experience.

## Usability Test Plan

### Purpose and Research Questions

The primary goal of the user test is to evaluate the usability, intuitiveness, and enjoyment of our habit-building app. Specifically, we try to answer the following key questions:

- How intuitive is it for users to create, complete, and manage habits in the app?
- Are the shop and pet interaction features engaging and easy to use?
- What areas of the app, if any, confuse or frustrate users?

Our app is designed for a wide audience since habits are universal and relevant for all age groups. However, the app's cute aesthetic may particularly appeal to younger users and potentially skew toward female users. We plan to recruit at least five participants for our user test.

### Data to Collect

To evaluate the app effectively, we will collect the following data:

- **Task Completion Time:** Measure the time it takes for users to complete each task, providing an objective measure of efficiency.
- **Task Completion Success:** Record whether participants can complete tasks without assistance (success or failure).
- **Perceived Ease of Use:** Use the Single Ease Question (SEQ) after each task to understand the perceived difficulty on a scale of 1 (Very Difficult) to 7 (Very Easy).
- **Overall Usability and Satisfaction:** Answer the System Usability Scale (SUS) after all tasks to gather insights into overall user satisfaction.
- **Qualitative Feedback:** Gather some qualitative feedback through open-ended questions to explore user experiences and suggestions.

#### Potential Qualitative Questions

- What did you enjoy most about the app?
- Was anything in the app frustrating or confusing?
- What feature or improvement would you suggest to make the app better?

### Methods to Use

Participants will complete a series of tasks designed to evaluate core app functionality:

1. Create a Habit
2. Complete a Habit (You donâ€™t have to actually do the task in real life)
3. Buy something from the shop
4. Interact with one of your pets

Each task will be clearly outlined in a task list provided to participants. As previously stated, we will use the SEQ after each task individually and also the SUS after all tasks are completed.

#### Recording and Observation

We will use screen-recording software to capture user interactions, focusing on navigation paths, errors, and behavior.

#### Post-Test Interview

After completing the tasks, we will conduct a brief interview to ask qualitative questions and clarify observations made during testing. This will provide additional insights into the user experience and areas for improvement.

### Data Visualization

To present the collected data effectively, we will use the following methods:

- **Task Completion Time:** Represented as a bar chart showing the average time taken for each task across all users.
- **Task Completion Success:** Displayed using a stacked bar chart to illustrate the number of users who successfully completed each task versus those who did not.
- **SEQ Results:** Shown as either a line chart or a bar chart to visualize the average SEQ score for each task.
- **SUS Score:** Depicted using a box plot to show the distribution of SUS scores among participants or as a single bar representing the average SUS score.
- **Qualitative Feedback:** Summarized in a word cloud to highlight recurring themes or presented in a table to categorize user suggestions and issues.

## Heuristic Evaluation

We analyzed the current version (20.01.2025) of our Mobile Application to find potential problems which we can work on in the coming week as well as analyze from the feedback we will gather in our upcoming user test.

### 10 Usability Heuristics

1. Visibility of System Status
2. Match Between System and the Real World
3. User Control and Freedom
4. Consistency and Standards
5. Error Prevention
6. Recognition Rather Than Recall
7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors
10. Help and Documentation

### Issues Table

| Issue | Description | Heuristic | Severity |
|-------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | The shop does not display all categories of items on first sight, you have to scroll down to see that there are different buying options than just pets. | 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall | 3 |
| 2 | In the Shop right now, you have to scroll all the way down to the section "Habitats" without a faster way to see only habitats, like for example filtering for only Backgrounds. | 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use | 5 |
| 3 | In the "Customize" window when you have a lot of different skins it would maybe be easier to filter for something you want to add instead of scrolling through. | 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use | 4 |
| 4 | On the calendar page right now, there is not really a way to switch to different months than the one you are currently in. Even though you maybe want to view your old achievements. | 3. User Control and Freedom | 7 |
| 5 | In the current version the "Icon" input field in the "Add New Habit" page seems a bit confusing because a user would not know what to input here by default. | 9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors | 7 |
| 6 | There is no description about what the app is used for which could potentially confuse people who download the app out of curiosity without having ever used a habit app. | 10. Help and Documentation | 5 |
